# Pharmaceutical-Drug-Dispatch-System
A set of web pages using HTML as front-end and PHP as back-end. The idea was to construct a website that works as an intermediary between hospitals and pharma companies. Companies and Hospitals can register on this website. Companies can upload the medicines that they manufacture and hospital can compare medicines that they need between the different companies that manufacture them. A link to directly contact the companies can also provided for the hospitals. I made this project during 2nd year of my engineering as my PHP mini project.
